It is interesting to see how a year ago, Uber and WeWork are still among the hotest companies in tech. Now a couple months later, they are abandoned by Wall Street. Everyone starts to talk about how unsustainable their business models are, and how they are never going to make any profit. They are the same people who supported the insane evaluation at the first place. 

I've read articles about who benefited most and who lost most from the canceled IPO of WeWork. Apparently Softbank's Vision Fund took the biggest hit, despite how it was treated as a legendary a few months ago. For the early investors and brokers, they got millions of dollars of commission fee and escaped the market, left the latecomers with the consequence of the dropped evaluations.
[Xuanzheng Lin] Well, I could not call WeWork as a canceled IPO. Instead, it is more like a delay due the sharp drop in its valuation. Since the Uber and Lyft IPOs' tragedies, a delay might be a very good idea. I did have some concerns regarding WeWork's business model as well.
